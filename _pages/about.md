# LCC: Laconic Cryptography Conference

---

The first edition of the Laconic Cryptography Conference will be co-located with [EUROCRYPT 2024](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2024/) in  Zurich, Switzerland.

**Abstract:** Laconic cryptography is an emerging paradigm that enables secure computation between potentially many senders and a "laconic" receiver. Abstractly, laconic cryptography can be thought of as a *reverse delegation* paradigm, where the party that does the computation is also the one that obtains the result. The simplest form of laconic cryptography is public-key encryption, where multiple encryptors can encrypt messages to a receiver using its public key. On the other hand, more sophisticated primitives have enabled several new results such as identity-based encryption from new assumptions (CDH), two-round MPC from minimal assumptions, rate-1 oblivious transfer, and much more. In addition, techniques from laconic cryptography have been useful to build registration-based encryption (RBE), a new proposal to solve the key escrow problem in identity-based encryption.

This area has matured significantly over the past years, and many new primitives and applications have been proposed. Furthermore, very recent works have shown how to overcome the efficiency drawbacks of the initial constructions, opening the door for schemes that are tantalizingly close to practical. The objective of this workshop is to (i) cover foundational aspects of laconic cryptography, (ii) survey recent developments in the area, and (iii) identify outstanding challenges that remain to make laconic primitives truly practical.
